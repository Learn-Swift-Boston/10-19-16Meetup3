Because we now care about more information, it makes sense to create a data object. We'll again want to make a struct `File -> New -> File... -> Swift File`. Add properties for `imageUrl`, `title`, and `year`. Implement the `didSelect()` function and manipulate the cell to show the data instead of the image.


The steps to making this project:

0. ~~start new project~~
1. ~~download itunes data~~
2. ~~create collection view cell for each album~~
3. ~~create a custom cell with default image for each album~~
4. ~~download album artwork and replace default image with it~~
5. display album title and year when cell is tapped (you are here)

There will be a branch representing each of the above steps. If you're having trouble, pull down that branch for a hint.
