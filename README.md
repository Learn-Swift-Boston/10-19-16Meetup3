Add some networking code to pull down the image for each album and apply it to our new custom cell (from the last step). The way I've done it isn't necessary the best, most performant, way. Can you figure out a better place to do it? Can you also find a more secure way to download the album images?


The steps to making this project:

0. ~~start new project~~
1. ~~download itunes data~~
2. ~~create collection view cell for each album~~
3. ~~create a custom cell with default image for each album~~
4. download album artwork and replace default image with it (you are here)
5. display album title and year when cell is tapped

There will be a branch representing each of the above steps. If you're having trouble, pull down that branch for a hint.
