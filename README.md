At this point, all we care about is hitting the API to get the data.
`File -> New -> File -> Swift File` lets your create an empty Swift file. In this case, we want a struct to hold all of our networking functions. In order to satisfy this step, all we have to do is use `print()` or `dump()` to ouput the response to the console.

The steps to making this project:

0. ~~start new project~~
1. download itunes data (you are here)
2. create collection view cell for each album
3. create a custom cell with default image for each album
4. download album artwork and replace default image with it
5. display album title and year when cell is tapped

There will be a branch representing each of the above steps. If you're having trouble, pull down that branch for a hint.
