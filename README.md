This is an empty project, just as if you'd started a Single View Application using Xcode. This is meant to give you a point 0 if you want to make the app on your own. You can do this on your own by selecting:
`File -> New -> Project... -> Single View Application`

The steps to making this project:

0. start new project (you are here)
1. download itunes data
2. create collection view cell for each album
3. create a custom cell with default image for each album
4. download album artwork and replace default image with it
5. display album title and year when cell is tapped

There will be a branch representing each of the above steps. If you're having trouble, pull down that branch for a hint.
