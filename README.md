Make a Collection View Controller Cell. `File -> New -> File -> Cocoa Touch Class` and make your file a subclass of UICollectionViewCell (check the XIB box). Register the nib with the collection view, add an image to your custom cell, and make sure you have all the identifiers set right.


The steps to making this project:

0. ~~start new project~~
1. ~~download itunes data~~
2. ~~create collection view cell for each album~~
3. create a custom cell with default image for each album (you are here)
4. download album artwork and replace default image with it
5. display album title and year when cell is tapped

There will be a branch representing each of the above steps. If you're having trouble, pull down that branch for a hint.
